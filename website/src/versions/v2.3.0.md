# V - 2.3.0

The new version is out! :tada:

This update brings a lot of improvements and fixes. As Always thanks to everyone for the feedback and support!

## Features
- Android 13 compatibility.
- New screen to ask for alarms and notifications permissions.
- New in-app rating screen.
- Added back the ticket screen to automatically send needed info to debug.

## Ui
 - New settings screens, now grouped in categories and individuals screens to make it easier to configure and less cramped.
 - New set of app icons.
 - Added swipe animations to delete and edit reminders.
 - Now rankings and exercises are individuals screens.
 - Reworked the welcome flow.

## Fixes
 - Reminders not starting right away, in order to make it more efficient we had delegated the start of the reminders to the Android OS but that resulted in reminders taking a lot of time to start so now we trigger them as soon as the reminder is activated.
 - Bug where the rotation of the screen caused it to give experience multiple times.
 - Barchart not showing days labels if it was a new account.

## Dev
 - Migrated to gradle version catalogs.
 - Removed Facebook Shimmer library.
 - Renamed all xml views to follow the same name convention.
 - Added new library that provides tailwind dimens and colors.
 - Removed app landscape orientation.
 - Migrated to kotlin flows.
 - Enforced detekt rules.
